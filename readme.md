# Docs Reader (Twitter Bootstrap)

This is a Documentation Reader forked from [Dayle Rees](https://github.com/daylerees/docs-reader) using the [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) front-end framework.

It's using [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) for its icons and [html5shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv) for HTML5 backward compatibility.
